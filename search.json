    "text": "Konfound-It!\nThe assumptions underlying statistical analysis are rarely fully met. Pragmatists face the challenge of knowing when evidence is strong enough to justify action, and that’s where sensitivity analysis helps by testing the robustness of inferences against potential biases. For instance, sensitivity indices can quantify how much of the observed effect would need to be bias-driven to alter conclusions. We are building on these ideas by developing the methods and associated resources listed on this page."

We believe that students should learn science the same way scientists do - through exploration, discovery, and sense-making grounded in observations of the natural world. In a way, science is like a puzzle - the bigger picture is revealed after hunting for and putting the pieces together. Our planet is full of exciting and intriguing phenomena - invite them into your science classroom today!"
